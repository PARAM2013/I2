# Import Success Dialog - Enhanced User Experience

## 🎉 What's New

Instead of just showing a simple snackbar message, users now get a **beautiful, informative popup dialog** when files are successfully imported!

## 🎨 New Success Dialog Features

### Visual Design
- ✅ **Large green checkmark icon** - Clear success indicator
- 🎨 **Modern Material 3 design** - Professional appearance
- 📱 **Responsive layout** - Works on all screen sizes
- 🌟 **Smooth animations** - Polished user experience

### Information Display

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Way):
1. Import files → Progress → Small snackbar message → Done

### After (New Way):
1. Import files → **Progress dialog** → **Success popup** → Clear next steps

## 🎯 Success Dialog Content

### For Successful Imports:
```
🎉 Import Successful!

5 files imported successfully to your secure vault.

💡 Your original files are still in their original location. 
   You can now safely delete them if desired.

[View Files] [OK]
```

### For Mixed Results:
```
✅ Import Completed

3 files imported successfully, 2 failed.

💡 Your original files are still in their original location. 
   You can now safely delete them if desired.

[View Files] [OK]
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New UI State Fields:
- `showImportSuccessDialog: Boolean` - Controls dialog visibility
- `lastImportSuccessCount: Int` - Stores success count
- `lastImportFailedCount: Int` - Stores failure count

### New Functions:
- `dismissImportSuccessDialog()` - Closes the dialog
- `viewImportedFiles()` - Navigates to imported files
- `testSuccessDialog()` - For testing purposes

### Smart Message Logic:
- **Success only**: Shows celebration message
- **Mixed results**: Shows both success and failure counts
- **Complete failure**: Still uses snackbar (less intrusive)
