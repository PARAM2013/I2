# Debug Import Progress Dialog

## What I've Added for Debugging

### 1. Debug Logging
- Added extensive logging to `MainDashboardViewModel.importFiles()`
- Added logging to `SimpleImportDialog` to see when it's called
- Added logging to track progress updates

### 2. Simple Test Dialog
- Created `SimpleImportDialog.kt` - a minimal version of the progress dialog
- Replaced the complex dialog with this simple one for testing
- Should be easier to debug and see if it appears

### 3. Test Function
- Added `testImportDialog()` function to manually trigger the dialog
- You can call this from anywhere to test if the dialog shows up

### 4. Added Delay
- Added 1-second delay between file imports to make progress visible
- This will make the dialog stay open longer so you can see it

## How to Test

### Method 1: Normal Import Test
1. Open the app and go to AllFilesScreen
2. Tap the + FAB button
3. Select "Import Files"
4. Choose some files
5. **Look for these logs in logcat:**
   ```
   MainDashboardVM: importFiles called with X files
   MainDashboardVM: Starting import progress dialog
   MainDashboardVM: Import progress state updated: isImporting=true
   SimpleImportDialog: Dialog called with isImporting=true
   SimpleImportDialog: Showing simple dialog
   MainDashboardVM: Processing file 1/X: filename.jpg
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Test (Add this temporarily)
Add this button somewhere in your UI to test:
```kotlin
Button(onClick = { viewModel.testImportDialog() }) {
    Text("Test Import Dialog")
}
```

## What to Look For

### In Logcat:
- Search for "MainDashboardVM" to see import logs
- Search for "SimpleImportDialog" to see dialog logs
- If you see the logs but no dialog, it's a UI issue
- If you don't see the logs, the function isn't being called

### On Screen:
- Simple dialog with "Importing Files..." title
- Progress bar
- File counter
- Cancel button

## Troubleshooting

### If No Dialog Appears:
1. **Check logs** - Are the import functions being called?
2. **Check UI state** - Is `importProgress.isImporting` actually true?
3. **Check dialog placement** - Is the dialog being rendered in the right place?

### If Logs Show But No Dialog:
- The dialog component might have an issue
- Try the test function to isolate the problem
- Check if there are any UI overlays blocking it

### If Import Doesn't Start:
- Check file picker is working
- Check permissions
- Check if `importFiles()` is being called

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current implementation** with the simple dialog
2. **Check logcat** for the debug messages
3. **Report what you see** - logs appearing, dialog showing, etc.
4. Once we confirm the simple dialog works, we can enhance it

## Temporary Changes Made

- Replaced `ImportProgressDialog` with `SimpleImportDialog`
- Added 1-second delay in import process
- Added extensive debug logging
- Added test function

**Remember to remove the delay and debug logs in production!**
