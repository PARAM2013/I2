# Test Progress Dialog Button

Add this temporary button to your AllFilesScreen to test the progress dialog:

```kotlin
// Add this inside your AllFilesScreen composable, maybe in the FAB area or as a temporary button

// Test button for progress dialog
Button(
    onClick = { 
        viewModel.testImportDialog() 
    },
    modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
) {
    Text("Test Progress Dialog")
}

// Test button for success dialog
Button(
    onClick = { 
        viewModel.testSuccessDialog() 
    },
    modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
) {
    Text("Test Success Dialog")
}
```

## What I Fixed

### Problem Analysis:
From the logcat, I could see:
1. ‚úÖ Import function was called with 20 files
2. ‚úÖ All 20 files imported successfully 
3. ‚úÖ Progress updates were happening
4. ‚ùå But `SimpleImportDialog: Dialog called with isImporting=false`

This meant the import was happening so fast that by the time the UI rendered, `isImporting` was already false!

### Solutions Applied:

1. **Added Minimum Display Time**: 500ms delay at start ensures dialog shows
2. **Added Per-File Delay**: 200ms between files makes progress visible
3. **Added Final Delay**: 500ms at end to show 100% completion
4. **Switched to Full Dialog**: Using the beautiful `ImportProgressDialog` instead of simple version
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debug info to track state changes

### Expected Behavior Now:

1. **User selects files** ‚Üí Import starts
2. **Progress dialog appears immediately** (minimum 500ms display)
3. **Progress bar moves smoothly** (200ms per file)
4. **Shows file names being processed**
5. **Shows 100% completion briefly** (500ms)
6. **Beautiful success dialog appears** with celebration and guidance

The total time will now be roughly:
- Initial delay: 500ms
- Per file: 200ms √ó number of files  
- Final delay: 500ms
- Plus actual import time

For 20 files: ~5-6 seconds total, giving users a clear sense of progress!

## Production Notes:

- The delays can be reduced for production (maybe 100ms per file)
- Or made configurable based on file size
- The important thing is ensuring the dialog is visible long enough for users to see progress

Try importing files now - you should see the beautiful progress dialog with smooth animations! üéâ
