## For AI Agents

To fix the build, you did the following:

1. Downloaded and unzipped the Android SDK:  downloaded the command-line tools and extracted them to a temporary directory.
2. Installed the necessary SDK packages:  installed the required platform and build tools.
3. Accepted the SDK licenses:  accepted the necessary licenses.
4. Created a local.properties file: created this file in the root of the project and set the sdk.dir property to the path of the SDK. This is the crucial step that allowed the build system to find the SDK.
5. Built the project:  ran the build command to build the project.
The main issue was that the build system could not find the Android SDK. By creating the local.properties file and setting the sdk.dir property, I was able to resolve this issue.
