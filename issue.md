# To fix the build issue, Jules you did the following:

1. Downloaded and unzipped the Android SDK: downloaded the command-line tools and extracted them to a temporary directory.
2. Installed the necessary SDK packages: installed the required platform and build tools.
3. Accepted the SDK licenses: accepted the necessary licenses.
4. Created a local.properties file: created this file in the root of the project and set the sdk.dir property to the path of the SDK. This is the crucial step that allowed the build system to find the Android SDK and build successfully.
5. **Added /app/local.properties to the .gitignore file:** This ensures that local.properties files containing machine-specific SDK paths are not committed to the repository. This is a standard and necessary practice to avoid sharing local environment configuration.
6. Built the project: ran the build command to build the project.  
   The main issue was that the build system could not find the Android SDK. By creating the local.properties file and setting the sdk.dir property, it was able to resolve this issue.

## Instructions for AI Agent (VM Build Environment)

**To prepare and build this project in a VM:**

1. **Download and set up the Android SDK:**

   ```sh
   mkdir -p /tmp/sdk && \
   wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-10406996_latest.zip -O /tmp/sdk/tools.zip && \
   unzip /tmp/sdk/tools.zip -d /tmp/sdk && \
   rm /tmp/sdk/tools.zip && \
   /tmp/sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/tmp/sdk "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;34.0.0" && \
   yes | /tmp/sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses --sdk_root=/tmp/sdk
   ```

2. **Create local.properties files:**

   - Create a file named `local.properties` in the root directory of the project with the following content:
     ```
     sdk.dir=/tmp/sdk
     ```
   - Create a file named `local.properties` inside the `app/` directory with the same content:
     ```
     sdk.dir=/tmp/sdk
     ```

3. **Ensure .gitignore is set up:**

   - Confirm that `/app/local.properties` is listed in your `.gitignore` file so that it will not be committed to the repository.

4. **Build the project:**

   - Run the appropriate Gradle build command, for example:
     ```sh
     ./gradlew build
     ```

### Notes

- **Do not commit any `local.properties` file to git.** The `.gitignore` must include `/app/local.properties`.
- For Windows/PC setup, use:
  ```
  sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\DC\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
  ```
- No other changes to build files are necessary; these steps solve the SDK path issue for consistent builds in both local and CI/VM environments.
