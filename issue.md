# To fix the build issue, Jules you did the following:

1. Downloaded and unzipped the Android SDK:  downloaded the command-line tools and extracted them to a temporary directory.
2. Installed the necessary SDK packages:  installed the required platform and build tools.
3. Accepted the SDK licenses: accepted the necessary licenses.
4. Created a local.properties file: created this file in the root of the project and set the sdk.dir property to the path of the SDK. This is the crucial step that allowed the build system to find the SDK.
5. Built the project: ran the build command to build the project.
   The main issue was that the build system could not find the Android SDK. By creating the local.properties file and setting the sdk.dir property, it was able to resolve this issue.

Jules Run this command for Download SDK in temp files.

mkdir -p /tmp/sdk &amp;&amp;
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-10406996_latest.zip -O /tmp/sdk/tools.zip &amp;&amp;
unzip /tmp/sdk/tools.zip -d /tmp/sdk &amp;&amp;
rm /tmp/sdk/tools.zip &amp;&amp;
/tmp/sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=/tmp/sdk "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;34.0.0" &amp;&amp;
yes | /tmp/sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses --sdk_root=/tmp/sdk

After download changes in this two files.
# File path:  local.properties
sdk.dir=/tmp/sdk

# File path:  app\local.properties
sdk.dir=/tmp/sdk

Note: Do Not commit local.properties file to git.


# For PC run
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\DC\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

---
you set the SDK path by creating a file named local.properties in the root directory of the project. This file contains a single line: sdk.dir=/tmp/sdk. This tells the Android build system where to find the SDK.

you also added /app/local.properties to the .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to the repository. This is a standard practice for this file, as it contains local path information that should not be shared across different development environments.

No other changes were made to the build files.
