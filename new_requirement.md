Thank you for clarifying that this is a **vault application** and that you do **not** want favorites or sharing features. I will give you a focused, practical guide to enhance your image/video viewer and player to provide the best vault/gallery-like user experience, tailored to your current code and requirements.

---

## 1. **General Philosophy for Vault UX**
- Prioritize **privacy** and **security** (no sharing/exporting, no unnecessary metadata).
- Provide a **smooth, modern, and distraction-free media browsing** experience.
- All actions should be local and secure—no network previews, no cloud, no external intents (unless for system image/video viewers, if you choose).

---

## 2. **Current Code Structure (Key Points)**
- **ImagesScreen**, **VideosScreen**: Jetpack Compose grids/lists for images and videos.
- **MediaViewActivity**: Old-style Activity with ViewPager2 + RecyclerView/Adapter for viewing full media.
- **MediaAdapter**: Handles displaying either ImageView or PlayerView depending on file type.
- **No zoom, pan, or advanced gestures.**
- **No Compose-based full-screen viewer.**

---

## 3. **Recommended Enhancements – Step-by-Step**

### A. Move to a Compose-based Fullscreen Viewer

- **Why:** Consistency with the rest of your Compose UI, easier to add gestures/animations, and more future-proof.
- **How:** Use a Compose screen with a `Pager` (from [Accompanist Pager](https://google.github.io/accompanist/pager/) or [Compose Foundation Pager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#foundation)).
- **Transition:** Animate from grid to viewer, and back.

**References:**
- [Compose Pager Docs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#foundation)
- [Accompanist Pager Migration](https://google.github.io/accompanist/pager/#migrating-to-compose-foundation)

---

### B. Add Modern Gallery Gestures

- **Image Viewer:**
  - Pinch-to-zoom and pan (use [Accompanist Zoom](https://google.github.io/accompanist/zoom/) or [ZoomableImage Compose sample](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/graphics/gestures)).
  - Double-tap to zoom in/out.
  - Swipe left/right to switch images/videos.
  - Swipe down to close viewer and return to grid.

- **Video Player:**
  - Use [Media3 ExoPlayer Compose integration](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#media3).
  - Show overlay controls (play/pause, seekbar, mute, speed).
  - Auto-hide controls after a few seconds of inactivity.

---

### C. UI/UX Guidelines

- **No share/export/favorite actions.**
- **Overlay controls:** Only show file name, info (date, resolution, size), and delete or "unhide" for files.
- **Dark mode support:** Use Compose themes.
- **Tap to toggle overlays.**
- **Smooth transitions:** Animate grid-to-viewer and viewer-to-grid.
- **Batch select:** If you want, allow multi-select in grid for delete/unhide, but NOT for sharing/exporting.

---

### D. Performance and Polish

- **Use Coil for image loading with thumbnail previews.**
- **Preload adjacent images/videos in the pager for fast navigation.**
- **Video Thumbnails:** Use MediaStore/ThumbnailUtils for video previews in grid.
- **Optimize memory:** Release video players when not visible.

---

### E. Secure Handling

- **File access:** Continue using internal storage/private directories.
- **No external URIs unless you want "Open in system viewer" (optional).**
- **No network access for thumbnails or previews.**
- **No unnecessary permissions.** Only storage if absolutely required.

---

### F. Accessibility

- Add content descriptions to images/videos.
- Ensure overlay controls are readable, with proper contrast.

---

## 4. **Sample Compose Fullscreen Viewer Pseudocode**

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalFoundationApi::class)
@Composable
fun VaultMediaViewer(
    mediaFiles: List<File>,
    initialIndex: Int,
    onClose: () -> Unit,
    onDelete: (File) -> Unit,
    onUnhide: (File) -> Unit
) {
    val pagerState = rememberPagerState(initialPage = initialIndex)
    HorizontalPager(count = mediaFiles.size, state = pagerState) { page ->
        val file = mediaFiles[page]
        if (file.isImage()) {
            // Use Accompanist ZoomableImage or your own Modifier.pointerInput for zoom/pan
            ZoomableImage(file)
        } else if (file.isVideo()) {
            // Use ExoPlayer Compose integration
            VideoPlayerComposable(file)
        }
        // Overlay (show/hide on tap)
        Box(Modifier.align(Alignment.TopEnd)) {
            IconButton(onClick = { onClose() }) { Icon(Icons.Default.Close, "Close") }
            // Show filename, delete, unhide, info...
        }
    }
}
```
- Add gestures for zoom, pan, swipe to close, etc.
- For images, use Coil + Accompanist Zoom.
- For videos, use ExoPlayer with Compose UI overlay.

## 5. **Development Steps Checklist**

1. **Migrate MediaViewActivity to Compose Pager screen.**
2. **Add pinch-to-zoom and pan for images.**
3. **Integrate ExoPlayer Compose for videos.**
4. **Implement overlay controls (file info, delete, unhide, close).**
5. **Add gestures: tap to toggle overlay, swipe down to close, swipe left/right for navigation.**
6. **Polish grid/list view (spacing, previews, selection).**
7. **Test for memory leaks, smoothness, and edge cases.**
8. **Verify no sharing or exporting is possible.**
9. **Test thoroughly for security (no data leaks, no permissions overreach).**

---

## 6. **Optional: System Viewer Integration**

- If you want, provide a menu action for "Open with system viewer" using `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` and FileProvider (but only if this fits your vault's security model).

---

## 7. **Sample Libraries to Use**

- [Coil Compose](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/)
- [Accompanist Zoom](https://google.github.io/accompanist/zoom/)
- [Media3 ExoPlayer Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#media3)
- [Compose Pager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#foundation)

---

## 8. **Example Overlay Controls Layout**

```kotlin
Box {
    // Media content
    ...
    // Overlay, toggled by tap
    AnimatedVisibility(visible = overlayVisible) {
        Column(
            Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth()
                .background(Brush.verticalGradient(...))
        ) {
            Text(file.name)
            Text("Size: ... Date: ...")
            Row {
                IconButton(onClick = { onDelete(file) }) { Icon(Icons.Default.Delete, "Delete") }
                IconButton(onClick = { onUnhide(file) }) { Icon(Icons.Default.LockOpen, "Unhide") }
                IconButton(onClick = { onClose() }) { Icon(Icons.Default.Close, "Close") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 10. **Final Advice**

- Build and test each improvement incrementally.
- Do not add features (favorites, sharing, export) forbidden by your vault’s privacy model.
- Prioritize smooth experience, security, and privacy in every detail.
- Use Compose everywhere for future maintainability.

**If you want a concrete code example for any of these steps (e.g., pinch-to-zoom, pager, overlay controls), just ask!**
