# Import Progress Feature Test

## What We Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UI State
- Added `ImportProgress` data class with:
  - `isImporting`: Boolean flag
  - `currentFileIndex`: Current file being processed
  - `totalFiles`: Total number of files to import
  - `currentFileName`: Name of current file being processed
  - `overallProgress`: Progress from 0.0 to 1.0
  - `successfulImports`: Count of successful imports
  - `failedImports`: Count of failed imports
  - `canCancel`: Whether user can cancel
  - `isCancelled`: Whether import was cancelled

### 2. Enhanced Import Function
- Real-time progress updates for each file
- File name extraction from URI
- Cancellation support
- Better error handling
- Custom success message: "Files imported successfully. Now you can delete original files if desired."

### 3. Import Progress Dialog
- Modal dialog that shows during import
- Progress bar with percentage
- Current file name being processed
- Success/failed counters
- Cancel button
- Professional UI design

### 4. Cancellation Support
- Users can cancel import at any time
- Proper cleanup when cancelled
- Clear feedback when cancelled

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Import
1. Open AllFilesScreen
2. Tap the + FAB button
3. Select "Import Files"
4. Choose multiple files from device
5. **Expected**: Progress dialog appears showing:
   - "Importing Files" title
   - Progress bar moving from 0% to 100%
   - Current file name being processed
   - Success counter incrementing
   - Cancel button available

### Test 2: Large File Import
1. Select large files (videos, high-res images)
2. Start import
3. **Expected**: 
   - Progress updates smoothly
   - File names display correctly
   - No UI freezing
   - Can cancel if needed

### Test 3: Cancellation
1. Start importing multiple files
2. Click "Cancel Import" button during process
3. **Expected**:
   - Import stops immediately
   - Dialog closes
   - Snackbar shows "Import cancelled by user."
   - Partially imported files remain in vault

### Test 4: Success Message
1. Complete a successful import
2. **Expected**: Snackbar shows:
   - "Files imported successfully. Now you can delete original files if desired."

### Test 5: Mixed Results
1. Import files where some might fail (corrupted files, etc.)
2. **Expected**: Message shows:
   - "X file(s) imported successfully, Y failed. You can delete the successfully imported original files."

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Clear Progress Feedback** - Users see exactly what's happening
✅ **Professional UX** - Modern progress dialog with smooth animations  
✅ **Cancellation Control** - Users can stop import if needed
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Progress updates for each file processed
✅ **Better Error Handling** - Clear success/failure counts
✅ **Custom Message** - Includes your requested text about deleting originals
✅ **No UI Blocking** - Import runs in background with visual feedback
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

- **Coroutine-based**: Uses `viewModelScope.launch` for background processing
- **State Management**: Reactive UI updates with StateFlow
- **Cancellation**: Proper coroutine cancellation with cleanup
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes files one by one, not all at once
- **Error Resilient**: Continues processing even if individual files fail
